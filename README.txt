** Module 3 - Javascript **

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data


The key lessons learned on this were:
1. Objects
2. Functions
3. Pulling a random element from a created array
4. a [] leaves the array empty to initiate
